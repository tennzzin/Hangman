__Hangman Game__

__Overview__

This project is a classic Hangman game implemented in Python. It randomly selects a word from a large online wordlist, challenging players to guess the letters before running out of attempts. The game dynamically updates the visual representation of the hangman as incorrect guesses are made.

__Features__
- Dynamic Word Selection: Fetches a random word from an online dictionary.
- Interactive Gameplay: Players receive feedback for correct, incorrect, or repeated guesses.
- Visual Feedback: ASCII art displays the hangman figure as the game progresses.
- Error Handling: Invalid inputs (e.g., numbers or multi-character guesses) prompt user correction.
- Win/Loss Conditions: Detects when the game is over and displays the correct word if the player loses.

__How to Play__
- Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hangman-game.git
  - cd hangman-game
- Run the game:
  - python hangman.py
  
__Follow the on-screen prompts__
- Guess one letter at a time.
- Avoid running out of attempts

__Technology Stack__
- Language: Python
- Core Concepts:
- File I/O: Fetches words dynamically from an online source.
- Control Flow: Manages game state using loops and conditional statements.
- ASCII Art: Enhances user experience with visual feedback.

__Skills Demonstrated__
- Data Handling: Used urllib to fetch and process an online wordlist.
- Error Management: Included input validation for robust gameplay.
- Game Logic: Designed intuitive and user-friendly mechanics with clear win/loss criteria.
